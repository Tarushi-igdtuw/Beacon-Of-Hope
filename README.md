## Challenges We Ran Into
**Working with Generative AI for the very first time:**
Gen AI, although a new buzzword, presented a steep learning curve for our team. As we ventured into incorporating Generative AI technology into our chatbot for the first time, we faced challenges in understanding its capabilities, limitations, and implementation. We had to invest time and resources in learning the intricacies of this emerging technology to ensure its effective integration into our platform.

**Setting up the Chrome extension with the mood tracker API and website:**
One of the main challenges I encountered during the development of our mood tracking feature was setting up the Chrome extension to communicate with the backend API and integrate smoothly with the website. As I was relatively new to Node.js and Chrome extensions, understanding how to create an API for mood tracking, handling data submissions at regular intervals, and ensuring proper data storage was a learning curve. Additionally, I had to ensure that the mood history could be displayed in a visually intuitive way on the website, utilizing data from the Chrome extension for accurate mood visualization. Managing these different components while ensuring a seamless user experience required significant troubleshooting and debugging, but it ultimately helped me enhance my skills in web development and API integration.
