## Backstory: Why We Built This Project
With rising mental health challenges worldwide, many people struggle to find consistent and personalized support. Traditional mental health care can be inaccessible for some, due to various reasons such as stigma, cost, or availability of resources. Our team wanted to create a solution that could bridge this gap by offering AI-driven support alongside community engagement. That's how "Beacon of Hope" was bornâ€”a holistic mental wellness platform designed to empower users with tools to track their moods, express gratitude, and connect with others in a supportive community.

## What it does ?

## Key Featuresâœ¨
** 1) Mood History: Track Your Emotional Journey**
Monitor Emotional Trends: Our Mood History feature allows users to log and visualize their daily emotions, helping them track their mental well-being over time.
Gain Insights: By observing patterns in their moods, users can better understand how their mental health evolves, offering a powerful tool for self-reflection.
Data Visualization: All submitted moods are stored and visualized on our website through interactive mood charts and mood count charts, offering users a clear understanding of their emotional journey.

## Challenges We Ran Into
**Working with Generative AI for the very first time: **
Gen AI, although a new buzzword, presented a steep learning curve for our team. As we ventured into incorporating Generative AI technology into our chatbot for the first time, we faced challenges in understanding its capabilities, limitations, and implementation. We had to invest time and resources in learning the intricacies of this emerging technology to ensure its effective integration into our platform.
